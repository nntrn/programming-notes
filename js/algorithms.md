## recursion
**When is recursion a good choice?**
Recursion, by nature, is a repetitive task. Therefore, recursion is optimal in cases where a task is repeated multiple times AND can be defined in it of itself. [^recursion]

> Another example would be the merge sort algorithm. In this algorithm, we are breaking up a collection into halves, until they all contain only one element.  Afterwards, it is repeatedly compared and merged back into a sorted collection. As you can see, merge sort is conceptually based upon breaking up a big task into smaller, equal processes. Therefore, the merge sort is also an ideal candidate for recursion
