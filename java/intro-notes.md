### [Java Program Template](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/j1a_Introduction.html)
You can use the following template to write your Java programs. Choose a meaningful "Classname" that reflects the purpose of your program, and write your programming statements inside the body of the main() method. Don't worry about the other terms and keywords now. I will explain them in due course. Provide comments in your program!

```java
/*
 * Comment to state the purpose of the program
 */
public class Classname {   // Choose a meaningful Classname. Save as "Classname.java"
   public static void main(String[] args) {  // Entry point of the program
      // Your programming statements here!!!
   }
}
```
